TODO:
- [ ] Discuss if updating the data can be skipped if the detected version/date/hash are the same
- [ ] Discuss cache location and handling concurrent accesses from different CV versions
- [ ] Build async interfaces?
- [ ] CURIE like interface (as in mzdata)
- [ ] Handle items from different CV names spaces in the same CV (eg NCIT and MS in the MS ontology)
- [ ] Handle indices that are not numeric (eg NCIT or GNOme ids)
- [ ] Handle LZW compression from IMGT
- [ ] Handle multiple files together
    - [ ] As fallback to get the file from different servers 
    - [-] Join multiple files into a single CVIndex (GNOme)
- [x] Write out errors when parsing file failed
- [x] Auto detect version + date + hash of newly loaded data
- [x] Always store the CV file compressed (using flate2)
- [x] Build update_from_url
- [x] Make the CVData less String relient
